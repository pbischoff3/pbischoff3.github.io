    "text": "About Introduction Methods Results Conclusion\n\n\n\nExperiences in the classrooms can lead to an increase of STEM motivation. This can come through many different aspects of the classroom experience. One study explored the positive impact that performing science practices (like hypothesizing or explaining results) can increase a students’ “felt recognition” and “classroom climate”, and these two factors increases students’ STEM motivation, STEM identity, and STEM career aspirations. Another study shares that an “intervention emphasizing communal utility value of biomedical research” can greatly increase a students’ motivation for biomedical sciences. The study also compared “self-oriented” versus “other-oriented” utility values, showing that “other-oriented” unity values shows a higher student motivation.\nPersonal experiences can also have a large influence on one’s STEM motivation. A study explored a cohort of medical students in Norway and their motivation to go into medicine. Though this is not necessarily “STEM” motivation, the comparison of medicine to STEM fields is important to note. This study went through different life experiences that the students had and compared those back to motivation for different fields in medicine. This was done through a survey, and they asked questions like “opportunity to perform research”, opportunity to care for people”, or “interest in relations between health, well-being and society”. All of these are based on experiences that students might have had on in the past in their lives, and findings show that these experiences can have a significant impact on the paths medical doctors choose. Another study explores literature regarding Black and Latinx students’ STEM motivation. In this literature review, it is clear that the life experiences that these student have can have a significant impact on their STEM motivation, compared back to experiences of the whole student population.\nPersonal experiences with medicine can influence career choice. A study explores the literature out there regarding how experiences in surgery can have an impact on their career choice. Particularly, much of the literature explores the role that rotations in medical school can influence career choice. This study makes it clear that the experiences people have with medicine can significantly impact what they choose to become. Another study explores the reasons students choose to go into medicine. Many of the common answers included “intellectual curiosity, professional autonomy, altruism, and interest in human relationships”. However, in this study, it was clear that students motivated by personal illness or family member’s illness “revealed significant[ly] greater emotional exhaustion”. This makes it clear that our experiences in life can influence our decision to go into medicine.\nChronic illnesses and medical experiences can potentially lead to more interruptions. One study explores the connection between chronic illness and suicidal ideation in adults in South Korea. What they found was that people with chronic illnesses need attention given to them in order to decrease suicidal ideation. Where suicide is tied to depression, the connection between having a chronic condition and potentially missing class becomes clear, as the students could miss more class due to the increase in depression. Another study explores how having chronic illnesses increase the incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia in older adults. In particular, it goes into what specific illnesses could cause an increase in incidence of pneumonia. Comparing this back to our study, students with chronic conditions could miss more classes due to illnesses (like pneumonia). Lastly, another study shows the influence that chronic illnesses (especially diabetes and psychiatric conditions) have on a person’s self-esteem. If a student has lower self-esteem, they may feel less likely to attend class, and therefore, these chronic conditions can lead to more medical interruptions.\n\n\n\nPorter has had a slew of medical experiences, and these experiences led him to pursue a career path in medicine. While going through his undergraduate experience, preparing for medical school, he found a real passion for science as well as medicine. Because this was relatively late in his education, he wishes that he knew this passion he had before his undergraduate studies. Therefore, this project was born, hoping to find that Porter wasn’t uncommon in his experience and assisting other students understand their passions for science sooner than later.

In this first course, there were 9 Cases, and after each case there was a quiz regarding things that were covered in the video case. The cases covered were across a broad range: pregnancy and asthma, travelers’ diarrhea, epilepsy, gastritis, heart attack, hematoma, anaphylaxis, COVID, and renal failure. The videos were given through a mock-visit with a patient, where the physician first meets the mock patient and cares for them as they would a typical patient. Essentially, we viewers were a fly on the wall who could see the whole process of treating these patients. You can learn more about this awesome course here. I finished this course over 1 month, averaging 3 hours a week going through this shadowing experience. Click here to download the certificate I was granted.\n\n\nLearnings\nWith my service in the American Fork Emergency Room, I felt like I had a decent grasp on how emergency rooms worked already. This shadowing opportunity gave me new insights into the treatment of patients in the ER. In my experience, I usually saw the tests and labs being run, with me checking on the patients where I was able. Rarely, there was the major trauma patient that came in, and when that happened, I could see how the physicians quickly cared for that patient. This shadowing experience let me see what initial contact with a patient and physician would look like, depending on the case and the symptoms. Not every case was a major trauma, and therefore, the ability to collect information from the patient and think quickly on their feet was shown to me. I felt like it showed me how to create trust with a patient from the beginning, and it was very informative. I think it gave me a really good background for in person shadowing experiences."

The general process of the shadowing experiences included an introduction of the physician and the profession, running through a case or two that the physician has seen, and general questions and answers afterwards. These were given during a livestream, but I was able to watch it afterwards due to them being recorded. Each of the experiences took roughly 1.5 hours after I created a write up.\n\n\nLearnings\nFor these videos, I decided to write a report after each session, focusing on what I liked about the profession, what I liked about the physician, what was difficult to be excited about for the profession, and what I learned.

Part of this class required us to do service in the community that we wouldn’t otherwise do. Between both semesters, I was able to use some of the life experiences I had in order to help other students going through similar issues. My mother is a health aide at the local school district, and there was a student who was type one diabetic and was about to graduate. He had poor diabetes habits, and I was asked to work with him to provide tips and tricks to adjusting to living on your own with diabetes. That was roughly 8 of these hours.\nThe other 7 hours came as I met with other individual students. I shared things I had learned from my experiences, such as with Station 1, the things I shared in my Wolverine Story, among other things. My goal here was to help each person I met with know that there is a place for them here.\n\n\nLearnings\nOverall, the thing I learned the most with these experiences was that I have a need to give back. I have had many people help me along my path, guiding me through diabetes, through school, and through general life challenges. I need to give back to others and be the same voice for them that I had in my life. Overall, students need to know they are not alone, that they are not “weirdos”, and this service helped me convey that to others. All in all, it helped me step outside of myself and be aware of the needs and struggles of others."

With that in mind, I found this service opportunity with the Loma Linda University Hospital. I have been making notes for these young patients that will be delivered to them with their breakfast. I have focused on making them silly and fun, helping them take their minds off the fact that they are in the hospital. I have been working on this for 2 months now, with an average of 1 hour a week being devoted to this project.\n\n\nLearnings\nWhat I have learned the most from this service is that looking outside yourself is the means by which amazing things can happen. When I was in the hospital, I had so many different people touch my life, and they made it easier for me to continue fighting the illnesses I had. I can provide an empathetic approach to making their days better, and that is the way by which I can give back to those that helped me."

At different points of time over the two years, I worked at a food pantry, set up a community event, worked at a thrift store, spent countless hours doing yard work, among other things.\n\n\nLearnings\nThis was the first time in my life where I feel I truly looked outside of myself. I was 19 years old when I began this service, and I felt like I truly dived in with the communities in which I lived. I feel that I learned empathy, love, and how important a kind word is, regardless of the person, the location, or the circumstance. It taught me to be less judgmental, and it increased my ability to strive to understand everybody."

One time when I was there, it was the beginning of college football season, and the mascots from two local rival colleges came handing out toys, coloring books, stress balls, and high fives. It truly lifted my spirits as a patient.\nWith the research that I do on campus, I knew that I wanted to implement some of the same sort of event at Primary Children’s. Seeing as I am studying how having medical conditions leads to science motivation, I want to provide an event where the science behind the medical care is made fun. We plan on teaching how x-rays work, what the heart looks like, what laboratory work looks like, etc. I applied for and was granted an URSCA Grant to pay for the toys and such needed for the event. Some of that funding is also going to an assistant student employee that will work underneath me, assisting me in this project. I will not be funded for this project, but he will, allowing him to add things to his medical school application.\n\n\nLearnings\nSo far, the majority of the work has been with preparing the grant. Now that we are approved, we need to make a connection with those at Primary Children’s. I am excited to report back on some of my learnings from this project."

Click here to download the certificate I was granted.\n\n\nLearnings\nWith my service in the American Fork Emergency Room, I felt like I had a decent grasp on how emergency rooms worked already. This shadowing opportunity gave me new insights into the treatment of patients in the ER. In my experience, I usually saw the tests and labs being run, with me checking on the patients where I was able. Rarely, there was the major trauma patient that came in, and when that happened, I could see how the physicians quickly cared for that patient. This shadowing experience let me see what initial contact with a patient and physician would look like, depending on the case and the symptoms. Not every case was a major trauma, and therefore, the ability to collect information from the patient and think quickly on their feet was shown to me. I felt like it showed me how to create trust with a patient from the beginning, and it was very informative. I think it gave me a really good background for in person shadowing experiences."

The general process of the shadowing experiences included an introduction of the physician and the profession, running through a case or two that the physician has seen, and general questions and answers afterwards. These were given during a livestream, but I was able to watch it afterwards due to them being recorded. Each of the experiences took roughly 1.5 hours after I created a write up.\n\n\nLearnings\nFor these videos, I decided to write a report after each session, focusing on what I liked about the profession, what I liked about the physician, what was difficult to be excited about for the profession, and what I learned.

    "section": "",
    "text": "In conclusion, this study sheds light on the potential impact of medical experiences and chronic conditions on students taking science classes at an open enrollment institution. The findings indicate that a considerable number of students, around 57%, reported having a medical experience, while 22% reported having a chronic condition. These numbers highlight the significance of investigating the influence of medical identities on students’ experiences further. The study’s main hypotheses were supported, revealing that an increase in academic interruptions due to medical experiences led to decreased science motivation, as well as lower senses of belonging, self-efficacy, and self-determination.\n\nNegative Effects\nIt was particularly interesting to observe that students who had more medical interruptions experienced a notable decrease in their sense of belonging and self-efficacy, emphasizing the potential challenges that medical experiences can pose to academic engagement and self-confidence. This insight is crucial for educators and institutions to recognize and address, as it may have profound implications for students’ overall success and well-being in science courses.\n\n\nPositive Effects\nHowever, a noteworthy and encouraging finding was that some students who had experienced medical experiences displayed higher levels of science immersion and motivation. This suggests that medical experiences can also positively influence student engagement with science, potentially prompting students to explore these experiences further within the context of scientific understanding. These positive associations between medical experiences and science motivation are promising, as they may indicate pathways for fostering increased interest and participation in scientific disciplines among affected students.\n\n\nImportance\nIn light of these results, it becomes evident that acknowledging and accommodating medical identities and experiences in science education is paramount. By recognizing the potential challenges students face due to medical interruptions and offering support and inclusive teaching strategies, educators can help mitigate the negative effects on students’ sense of belonging and self-efficacy. Moreover, incorporating medical experiences into the curriculum could harness the positive influence they have on science motivation, thereby fostering a more engaging and supportive learning environment for all students.\n\n\nNext Steps\nMoving forward, science instructors and institutions should consider the implications of this study as they modify course content and pedagogy to be more inclusive and supportive of students with medical experiences and chronic conditions. Emphasizing a student-centered approach and providing appropriate resources can help create a conducive learning environment where all identities, including those shaped by medical experiences, are embraced and empowered. By doing so, science education can evolve to be more inclusive, enriching the educational journey of all students and ultimately contributing to a more diverse and innovative scientific community."

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to Porter at portergbischoff@gmail.com !\n\n\nPrior research has investigated the recruitment and retention of certain student identities (such as gender and ethnicity) in STEM courses and careers. Success in STEM can be influenced by a student’s connection to the STEM community, science identity, and engagement. Despite this, no research has investigated the impact of having either a medical experience or chronic condition on STEM students despite research indicating medical students with medical conditions are less likely to complete their degree. Additionally, individuals with medical conditions tend to feel disconnected from others and experience higher levels of stress during their life. Thus, it is important to study the potential impacts of medical experiences and conditions on undergraduate students’ STEM motivation.\nThis study explores the potential impact of having a medical experience or chronic condition for students taking science classes at an open enrollment institution. Specifically, we hypothesized that an increase in academic interruptions due to a medical experience would result in decreased science motivation, a lower sense of belonging, self-efficacy, and self-determination. Pre- and post-course data were collected from 390 students across 14 biology courses (including non-majors) at a teaching-focused institution. Surprisingly, 57% of students surveyed reported having a medical experience and 22% reported having a chronic condition, indicating these are indeed an important and large identity to investigate further.\nAs predicted, students who have more medical interruptions have a significantly lower sense of belonging and self-efficacy (small effect size). Interestingly, students who indicated that they have had medical experiences and as a result, more engagement with science, have significantly higher science immersion and motivation. Therefore, medical experiences could be influencing student engagement with science in both positive and negative ways. The more interruptions to a student’s academics, the more impact it can have on their sense of belonging and self-efficacy. However, if those medical experiences result in more engagement with science, students may be more motivated to understand those experiences in the context of science. Information on the impact medical experiences can have on students is crucial to investigate as science instructors modify course content and pedagogy to be more inclusive of all identities present in the student population.\n\n\n\nPorter Bischoff*, Kody Garrett, Clayton Rawson, Joshua Premo, Brittney N.

While going through his undergraduate experience, preparing for medical school, he found a real passion for science as well as medicine. Because this was relatively late in his education, he wishes that he knew this passion he had before his undergraduate studies. Therefore, this project was born, hoping to find that Porter wasn’t uncommon in his experience and assisting other students understand their passions for science sooner than later.

    "text": "Utah Council of Undergraduate Research (UCUR) - February 2023\nThis presentation took place in a venue for different undergraduate institutions across the state, and it was hosted at the University of Utah this year. This was a great experience for me, as it was the first time that I gave a presentation about my research. This was a whole different perspective for science teaching. It was unexpected, but presenting at this conference helped me see insights for better ways effective write about the research that I was doing.\n\n\n\nClick to Download Presentation \n\nAbstract\nPrior research has investigated the recruitment and retention of certain student identities (such as gender and ethnicity) in STEM courses and careers. Recruitment and retention in STEM can be influenced by a student’s connection to the STEM community, science identity, and engagement. Yet none of this research has investigated the impact of having either a medical experience or chronic condition on our STEM students despite other research indicating medical students with medical conditions are less likely to complete their degree. Additionally, individuals with medical conditions tend to feel disconnected from others and experience higher levels of stress during their life. Thus, it is important to study the potential impacts of medical experiences and conditions on undergraduate students. This study explores the potential impacts of having a medical experience or chronic condition on students taking science classes at an open enrollment institution. Specifically, we hypothesized acute medical experiences may include a limited number of interruptions to one’s daily lifestyle and education and thus have a smaller impact on science students in comparison to students with chronic medical conditions. We specially focused on how acute medical experiences and chronic conditions may be related to varying levels of student science career motivation, science interest, science self-determination, engagement of science outside of the classroom, communal view of science, and value of peers in their classroom. Pre-course data was collected from 1280 students across 14 biology courses (including non-majors) taught by 16 different instructors at a focused-teaching institution. Surprisingly, 55% of students surveyed reported having an experience with an acute medical condition and 20% reported having a chronic condition. This indicates that medical experiences and chronic medical conditions are indeed an important and large identity to investigate further. Interestingly, there were no significant variations for students with acute medical experiences across science career motivation, science interest, science self-determination, engagement of science outside of the classroom, communal view of science, and value of peers in their classroom. However, we did see significant differences for students with chronic medical conditions depending on the major of the student (biology major, non-biology STEM major, pre-health professional major, or non-STEM major). Specifically, non-STEM majors had more appreciation and engagement with STEM if they also had a chronic medical condition. Further investigation of the potential differences for students with chronic medical conditions will continue to be explored with a post-survey."

    "text": "International Network for Social Network Analysis Sunbelt Conference (INSNA) - July 2023\n“INSNA is the professional association for researchers interested in social network analysis. The association is a non-profit organization incorporated in the state of Delaware and founded by Barry Wellman in 1977.\nThe principal functions of INSNA are as follows:\n\nWe publish Connections, a bulletin containing news, scholarly articles, technical columns, and abstracts and book reviews.\nWe sponsor the annual International Social Networks Conference (also known as Sunbelt).”\n\nPresenting at INSNA was a wonderful opportunity, as I attended this conference directly after ADA (my flight flew from San Diego to Portland directly). This experience was more difficult for me, as social networking is a field I am very new in. Presenting to experts in the field from across the world was very intimidating. This experience required me to get confident really quickly or else I would sound like a fool. I was able to stand firmly in the research that I had done to that point, and I was able to present the work that we had done well.\n\nAbstract\nNetwork visualization is a fundamental part of social network analysis. As one of the first things we are taught, visualizing social networks (and networks in general) can be informative and exciting. We introduce the R programming package netplot for network visualization. netplot provides out-of-the-box high-quality graph visualizations. It was designed with the primary goal of creating beautiful figures with minimal effort. netplot provides a flexible way to personalize network drawing by allowing the user an extensive array of graphical parameters. Netplot was designed on top of ‘The Grid Graphics Package,’ the same powering the popular R package ggplot2. netplot provides automatic vertex scaling, full-screen mode, edge color mixer, and low dependency footprint among its main features. To date, this R package has over 6,000 downloads. This poster project will showcase its usage and the new features implemented in the University of Utah’s “Summer Program for Undergraduate Research (SPUR).” We will present an application of netplot to two different types of epidemiological datasets: one with multiple networks and another with a single large graph. The first dataset features interactions between patients and providers in long-term healthcare facilities in the Veterans Affairs (VA) system. This bipartite graph contains multiple vertex classes, including the type of healthcare professional and the patient’s health condition. The second example will depict the usage of the package in a large inferred transmission network of COVID-19. With it, we will illustrate the capabilities of netplot to handle large network data, which can often be challenging to manage. Both examples will highlight netplot’s features and best practices for network visualization.\n\nClick to Download Poster"

While going through his undergraduate experience, preparing for medical school, he found a real passion for science as well as medicine. Because this was relatively late in his education, he wishes that he knew this passion he had before his undergraduate studies. Therefore, this project was born, hoping to find that Porter wasn’t uncommon in his experience and assisting other students understand their passions for science sooner than later.

While going through his undergraduate experience, preparing for medical school, he found a real passion for science as well as medicine. Because this was relatively late in his education, he wishes that he knew this passion he had before his undergraduate studies. Therefore, this project was born, hoping to find that Porter wasn’t uncommon in his experience and assisting other students understand their passions for science sooner than later. To learn more about how this project became to be, please go to this link!"

This scholarship is NSF funded and is focused on giving undergraduate students research opportunities. It included a full-ride scholarship, $1000 per year for research expenses, $1000 per year for travel expenses, and the opportunity to create a project with hand-picked faculty advisors. I knew that I was interested in making others’ path that are similar to mine easier, especially for those who have had medical conditions. A lot of the faculty was interested in pursuing wet-lab studies focused on mushrooms, pigeon feather color, or drosophila, and all of those opportunities would have taught me a lot. Seeing as my degree is in biology, I knew that I would have exceeding amounts of wet lab experience, so I decided that I wanted to pursue a research project that would give me skills I otherwise couldn’t experience. I decided to work with Drs. Britt Wyatt and Josh Premo studying science motivation. I specifically chose to study how having medical experiences leads to STEM motivation, as that was the path that I took personally. For more information on this research, follow this link to see my presentations at conferences. I have been involved with this research since September of 2020, and I have spent on average 5 hours a week on these projects, with many of the weeks before presentations requiring more hours.\n\n\nLearnings\nThis research experience has been the largest influence on my growth as a scientist. This project was mine. With help from Drs. Wyatt and Premo, I designed this project, was responsible for its growth, and ultimately saw the project through. The scientific process was at the core of everything I did, and I learned how to effectively apply that process to both bioinformatics and statistical analysis. Instead of increasing on my wet lab research, I learned a completely different facet of research that could be applied to any research projects I will do in the future. Statistical analysis is needed for any project, and I now am competent in R and am learning Python. These skills, as well as skills in presenting scientific research, has ultimately changed the path I am taking towards my professional goals."

A unique internationally-recognized model of higher education, the SFF includes an exciting research internship in emerging areas of science and technology with leading established and startup partner companies, research institutes, and nonprofit organizations, a cross-interdisciplinary shared curriculum, and personal and professional advancement activities including inclusive leadership and collaboration, scientific and technical communication, networking, and more. Station1 coordinates an exceptional portfolio of internship research projects in all science and technology majors, including, for example, areas such as biotechnology and public health (e.g. tissue engineering, marine genomics, synthetic biology, AI/ML diagnostics, circular biomaterials), civic technologies, environmental and clean technologies, inclusive digital networks and media, and sustainable advanced manufacturing and next generation infrastructure (Source).”   I was partnered with a company called GCTx (George Church Therapeutics). This company was born from the Church Lab at Harvard. George Church “helped initiate the Human Genome Project in 1984 and the Personal Genome Project in 2005 (Source), and he is a Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and Professor of Heath Sciences and Technology at Harvard and MIT. GCTx”uses synthetic biology to program stem cells into any cell type with best-in-class efficiency (up to 10X), speed (up to 100X) and scalability. We dictate cells fates in a single step and have validated cells for many applications. We have also developed SuperCells™ by tailoring cells for specific diseases (Source).” My role with the company was to explore all diseases in a specific organ system and determine the efficacy of the application of their innovative cell therapy for the curing of those diseases. I was involved with Station1 for 10 weeks, averaging 27 hours a week on this project.\n\n\nLearnings\nThis research experience taught me how to research difficult subjects largely on my own. The company informed my partner and I that their goal for us was that we would become experts on all diseases involved with the specific organ system we were studying. The Fellowship was totally virtual, and this made the research be largely dependent on my individual motivation. I did have weekly meetings with advisors where we could ask questions, but outside of those 2 hours a week meetings, I was responsible for the success of my part of the research. At the end of this research experience, our advisor informed us that we had a knowledge of the specific organ system we studied comparable to a Junior in medical school, and again, this knowledge came largely through my own actions. I feel that this experience taught me one of my most important life lessons: I feel that I (as well as everyone else) has the capability to learn anything. It may take me more time to learn something than the next guy, but I know that with enough work, anybody can learn anything.\n\nThe end deliverable for this research experience can be found here."

In my time with them, we explored all possible diseases in 2 other organ systems, bringing the number of organ systems I studied to 3 in all my time with GCTx. I was involved with this project for 7 months, giving roughly 5 hours a week to this project.\n\n\nLearnings\nMuch as before, this was an experience that was totally virtual with even less meetings with our advisors. This helped me improve on my self motivation regarding research. Also, we were expected to do almost double the work in less than half the amount of time that we had in the summer, requiring better, more concise research. Lastly, this all occurred during 2 busy school semesters that both included 16 credit hours and Organic Chemistry. I had to learn how to effectively manage so many things on my plate at the time."

I had been working as a Presidential Intern, going to school full time, and studying for the MCAT. Overall, I would say I have learned the most about my personal way to manage time. There was a lot on my plate, and I needed to find out quickly how to juggle it all at once. This has made me a better organized person. Also, managing the schedule for the Stake Presidency requires me to work with the members of the stake extensively. This helped me better treat people one by one, providing them the same love and care that I would hope is provided to me. Also, this is a position that I cannot fulfill on my own, and because of that, I have began to learn the importance of delegation. Asking for help is a hard thing, but this position requires me to.

I was involved with this position for 15 months, working roughly 1 hour per month on this.\n\n\nLearning\nThe most influential thing I learned from this experience was through my interactions with other students who had similar goals I had. They taught me how to be a better doctor in the future, and together we created a cohort of people to support each of us on our path. I learned how to be a better member of a team and a cohort."

Each intern will work directly with a member of UVU’s cabinet to create and implement high impact projects on behalf of UVU’s leadership and the university as a whole. Through working alongside cabinet, students will gain a greater knowledge of UVU’s mission, core values, and an inside look at higher education. Students will gain knowledge and skills that will enrich their academic, professional, and personal experiences (Source).” I had the opportunity to work with Provost Wayne Vaught in his management of Academic Affairs. I work 28 hours a week in this position, and I have worked here for roughly 4 months.\n\n\nLearning\nThis Internship has been career changing. The thing I have learned the most so far in this internship is the ability to be professional in nature. Our cohort of interns have met some very influential and “important” people both at our university as well as in the community. This was awfully intimidating at first, but I have had great growth in that area. I have had many opportunities where I am part of a cohort of 13 that represent the student body of our university, and I have learned to not take that responsibility lightly. Overall, I feel that I am more prepared to work in a professional, executive world. These influential people have taught me so much, and I am excited to continue learning from them as the internship continues."

I was involved with this for 3 months, giving roughly 33 hours a month towards leadership.\n\n\nLearning\nBeing a Fellow in this program taught me how to be a better part of a team, particularly in a virtual nature. The idea of science and technology being socially-directed taught me the importance of making and maintaining relationships. This helped me become a better leader because I put a higher value on my relationships."

Each morning, I was responsible for the feeding, bathing, dressing, and care for this man. He had majorly stunted mental capabilities, and each seizure had the potential to further stunt his mental abilities or even cause death. As these drop-fall seizures were dangerous and unexpected, my job was to catch and hold him through the seizure to avoid further injuries. I worked in this position for 9 months, working approximately 13 hours a week.\n\n\nLearnings\nThis job was a stressful one, as the family told me from day one that the man would one day pass away from his seizures, and there was a chance that could happen while I worked with him. This helped me learn how to “leave work at work”. I was attending school full-time, and I didn’t have the mental fortitude to deal with that stress along with my academics at the beginning. At the end of this experience, I am happy to say that I had learned how to effectively manage my mental load.\nAlso, as the man had severe autism, I learned how to be compassionate with those who struggled in expressing themselves. The patient was unable to communicate at all, but he was receptive to social expressions. By the end of my time at this job, the patient and I had a relationship, something that was difficult for the patient to do."

Much of the work was typical CNA-type things, including toileting, dressing, feeding, and medication assistance. I worked in this position for 2 months, working roughly 9 hours a week.\n\n\nLearnings\nSpending time with this man was very informative for me in my path in becoming a physician. Up until this experience, I hadn’t spent much time with elderly patients. I was able to see the functions of a rest home while only being responsible for one patient.

I was responsible for the overnight care of the patient. Where he has muscle atrophy, he cannot roll around, but where it isn’t paralysis, he could feel when bed sores were being formed. Therefore, my main task was to help him get into bed, roll him when he needed rolled, and provide CNA-type care when needed, including toileting, transferring, and cooking. I worked in this position for 6 months, working roughly 28 hours a week. Over Winter Break 2022, I was able to work with the man for 20 hours as well.\n\n\nLearnings\nThis job was informative because it was my first form of patient contact where the patient was competent mentally. This allowed for a different kind of caretaker/patient relationship. The patient and I truly became friends. With his condition and his mental wellbeing, he was able to tell me when he was uncomfortable, showing me a new light in being as careful and kind to patients as possible. This position turned into so much more than a job; instead it turned into an opportunity to provide help to someone who physically cannot themselves. This has been a transformative experience for me thus far, and I am excited to continue to learn."

Understanding how these medical experiences contribute to or shape STEM motivation provides valuable insights into the factors that drive students’ interest in these fields. Classroom Experiences Throughout the Semester as Motivational Factors:\nClassroom interactions and experiences play a pivotal role in shaping students’ STEM motivation. The study highlights the importance of examining how various aspects of the classroom environment, teaching methods, and curriculum content influence students’ motivation to pursue STEM disciplines. Identifying these specific factors is essential for creating effective strategies to enhance STEM motivation. Temporal Evolution of STEM Motivation:\nA notable trend observed in this cohort of students is the increase in STEM motivation throughout the semester. This temporal evolution suggests that the learning experiences and educational environment have a positive impact on students’ motivation over time. Analyzing the factors contributing to this increase can provide valuable insights into effective pedagogical approaches and interventions. In summary, these findings collectively underscore the complex interplay between medical experiences, classroom dynamics, and the temporal evolution of STEM motivation. Understanding these relationships is crucial for educators, policymakers, and researchers seeking to enhance and sustain students’ interest and motivation in STEM disciplines. This comprehensive perspective contributes to the broader dialogue on educational strategies and interventions aimed at fostering a sustained passion for STEM subjects among students."

    "text": "Next Steps\nBuilding upon the findings of this study, it becomes imperative for science instructors and institutions to recognize the broader implications, particularly in the context of students with medical experiences and chronic conditions. The insights gleaned from the examination of STEM motivation in these specific cohorts can inform meaningful adjustments in course content and pedagogy to foster inclusivity and support.\nAs the study suggests a significant influence of medical experiences and a temporal evolution of STEM motivation, it underscores the need for a nuanced and adaptable educational approach. In acknowledging the diverse identities shaped by medical experiences, it becomes essential to move beyond a one-size-fits-all model and embrace a student-centered approach.\nMoreover, the study aligns with a larger initiative exploring the impact of being a first-generation student and dealing with medical conditions or chronic illnesses on STEM motivation. This intersectionality highlights the complexity of students’ experiences and the importance of tailored support mechanisms.\nIn light of these findings, science education should evolve towards inclusivity, where students with varied backgrounds and medical histories feel not only welcomed but empowered. Institutions can play a pivotal role by providing resources that cater to the specific needs of these students. Emphasizing inclusivity not only enhances the educational journey of individuals with medical experiences but also contributes to a more diverse and innovative scientific community.\nIn conclusion, the implications of this study extend beyond the immediate findings, urging a transformation in science education that is considerate of the multifaceted identities of students. By embracing inclusivity and tailoring support, institutions can contribute to a more equitable and enriched learning environment, fostering the next generation of diverse and motivated STEM professionals."

I am studying Biology, and I hope to pursue an MD/PhD degree following my time here.  While studying at UVU, I have been blessed with so many wonderful opportunities. As a biology student, I was granted the NSF S-STEM scholarship, allowing me to have a strong focus on research I am interested in as an undergraduate. I was involved with Station1 as a Station1 Frontiers Fellow. This was a wonderful experience that included “an exciting research internship in emerging areas of science and technology with leading established and startup partner companies, research institutes, and nonprofit organizations, a cross-interdisciplinary shared curriculum, and personal and professional advancement activities including inclusive leadership and collaboration, scientific and technical communication, networking, and more.” I worked with GC Therapeutics as an intern following my time with Station1, and this provided me the unique experience of working with a biotech startup on the cutting edge of curing incurable diseases through stem cell implantation. Currently, I am an intern at Utah Valley University with Provost Wayne Vaught as his Presidential Intern. In this position, I have learned professionalism in a way that I couldn’t have otherwise. This position has provided me the opportunity to meet with professionals both at the university as well as in the community, and it has given me the chance to learn from some of the best people that the state has to offer.  I am the oldest of 5, and I love my family so much. They are truly my best friends. I have a dog named Bubba that enjoys doing homework with me, and I love watching basketball. Sadly, I am a disappointed Utah Jazz fan."

    "text": "This study explores the impact of chronic conditions on STEM motivation among undergraduate students, addressing a gap in existing research that primarily focuses on gender and ethnicity. Specifically, we investigate how medical experiences, especially chronic conditions, influence students in science classes at an open enrollment institution, considering demographics such as first- generation status, gender, major, and career goals.\nData from 390 students across 14 biology courses, including non-majors, were collected before and after the courses. Surprisingly, 57% reported medical experiences, with 22% having chronic conditions, emphasizing their significance within the diverse student population.\nStudents facing more medical interruptions exhibited a notable decrease in their sense of belonging and self-efficacy, albeit with a small effect size. Intriguingly, across demographics, students with chronic conditions engaging more with science showed significantly higher levels of motivation and immersion. This suggests that chronic conditions can both positively and negatively influence student engagement with science.\nThe impact of medical interruptions on academics is closely linked to students’ sense of belonging and self-efficacy.\nHowever, increased engagement with science due to chronic conditions may motivate students to explore these experiences within the context of scientific inquiry.\nUnderstanding how chronic conditions shape students’ motivation is crucial for science instructors to adapt their course content and pedagogy, fostering inclusivity and recognizing diverse identities across different demographic dimensions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPorter has had a slew of medical experiences, and these experiences led him to pursue a career path in medicine. While going through his undergraduate experience, preparing for medical school, he found a real passion for science as well as medicine. Because this was relatively late in his education, he wishes that he knew this passion he had before his undergraduate studies. Therefore, this project was born, hoping to find that Porter wasn’t uncommon in his experience and assisting other students understand their passions for science sooner than later.
