I am studying Biology, and I hope to pursue an MD/PhD degree following my time here.  While studying at UVU, I have been blessed with so many wonderful opportunities. As a biology student, I was granted the NSF S-STEM scholarship, allowing me to have a strong focus on research I am interested in as an undergraduate. I was involved with Station1 as a Station1 Frontiers Fellow. This was a wonderful experience that included “an exciting research internship in emerging areas of science and technology with leading established and startup partner companies, research institutes, and nonprofit organizations, a cross-interdisciplinary shared curriculum, and personal and professional advancement activities including inclusive leadership and collaboration, scientific and technical communication, networking, and more.” I worked with GC Therapeutics as an intern following my time with Station1, and this provided me the unique experience of working with a biotech startup on the cutting edge of curing incurable diseases through stem cell implantation. Currently, I am an intern at Utah Valley University with Provost Wayne Vaught as his Presidential Intern. In this position, I have learned professionalism in a way that I couldn’t have otherwise. This position has provided me the opportunity to meet with professionals both at the university as well as in the community, and it has given me the chance to learn from some of the best people that the state has to offer.  I am the oldest of 5, and I love my family so much. They are truly my best friends. I have a dog named Bubba that enjoys doing homework with me, and I love watching basketball. Sadly, I am a disappointed Utah Jazz fan."

    "text": "About Introduction Methods Results Conclusion\n\n\n\nExperiences in the classrooms can lead to an increase of STEM motivation. This can come through many different aspects of the classroom experience. One study explored the positive impact that performing science practices (like hypothesizing or explaining results) can increase a students’ “felt recognition” and “classroom climate”, and these two factors increases students’ STEM motivation, STEM identity, and STEM career aspirations. Another study shares that an “intervention emphasizing communal utility value of biomedical research” can greatly increase a students’ motivation for biomedical sciences. The study also compared “self-oriented” versus “other-oriented” utility values, showing that “other-oriented” unity values shows a higher student motivation.\nPersonal experiences can also have a large influence on one’s STEM motivation. A study explored a cohort of medical students in Norway and their motivation to go into medicine. Though this is not necessarily “STEM” motivation, the comparison of medicine to STEM fields is important to note. This study went through different life experiences that the students had and compared those back to motivation for different fields in medicine. This was done through a survey, and they asked questions like “opportunity to perform research”, opportunity to care for people”, or “interest in relations between health, well-being and society”. All of these are based on experiences that students might have had on in the past in their lives, and findings show that these experiences can have a significant impact on the paths medical doctors choose. Another study explores literature regarding Black and Latinx students’ STEM motivation. In this literature review, it is clear that the life experiences that these student have can have a significant impact on their STEM motivation, compared back to experiences of the whole student population.\nPersonal experiences with medicine can influence career choice. A study explores the literature out there regarding how experiences in surgery can have an impact on their career choice. Particularly, much of the literature explores the role that rotations in medical school can influence career choice. This study makes it clear that the experiences people have with medicine can significantly impact what they choose to become. Another study explores the reasons students choose to go into medicine. Many of the common answers included “intellectual curiosity, professional autonomy, altruism, and interest in human relationships”. However, in this study, it was clear that students motivated by personal illness or family member’s illness “revealed significant[ly] greater emotional exhaustion”. This makes it clear that our experiences in life can influence our decision to go into medicine.\nChronic illnesses and medical experiences can potentially lead to more interruptions. One study explores the connection between chronic illness and suicidal ideation in adults in South Korea. What they found was that people with chronic illnesses need attention given to them in order to decrease suicidal ideation. Where suicide is tied to depression, the connection between having a chronic condition and potentially missing class becomes clear, as the students could miss more class due to the increase in depression. Another study explores how having chronic illnesses increase the incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia in older adults. In particular, it goes into what specific illnesses could cause an increase in incidence of pneumonia. Comparing this back to our study, students with chronic conditions could miss more classes due to illnesses (like pneumonia). Lastly, another study shows the influence that chronic illnesses (especially diabetes and psychiatric conditions) have on a person’s self-esteem. If a student has lower self-esteem, they may feel less likely to attend class, and therefore, these chronic conditions can lead to more medical interruptions.\n\n\n\nPorter has had a slew of medical experiences, and these experiences led him to pursue a career path in medicine. While going through his undergraduate experience, preparing for medical school, he found a real passion for science as well as medicine. Because this was relatively late in his education, he wishes that he knew this passion he had before his undergraduate studies. Therefore, this project was born, hoping to find that Porter wasn’t uncommon in his experience and assisting other students understand their passions for science sooner than later.

    "text": "Course #1: University of Colorado ER (Virtual)\n\nDescription\nThis virtual shadowing Canvas course, made available through the Department of Emergency Medicine at the University of Colorado, gave me an opportunity to watch how people practice medicine in a different place in the world than I am used to. In this first course, there were 9 Cases, and after each case there was a quiz regarding things that were covered in the video case. The cases covered were across a broad range: pregnancy and asthma, travelers’ diarrhea, epilepsy, gastritis, heart attack, hematoma, anaphylaxis, COVID, and renal failure. The videos were given through a mock-visit with a patient, where the physician first meets the mock patient and cares for them as they would a typical patient. Essentially, we viewers were a fly on the wall who could see the whole process of treating these patients. You can learn more about this awesome course here. I finished this course over 1 month, averaging 3 hours a week going through this shadowing experience. Click here to download the certificate I was granted.\n\n\nLearnings\nWith my service in the American Fork Emergency Room, I felt like I had a decent grasp on how emergency rooms worked already. This shadowing opportunity gave me new insights into the treatment of patients in the ER. In my experience, I usually saw the tests and labs being run, with me checking on the patients where I was able. Rarely, there was the major trauma patient that came in, and when that happened, I could see how the physicians quickly cared for that patient. This shadowing experience let me see what initial contact with a patient and physician would look like, depending on the case and the symptoms. Not every case was a major trauma, and therefore, the ability to collect information from the patient and think quickly on their feet was shown to me. I felt like it showed me how to create trust with a patient from the beginning, and it was very informative. I think it gave me a really good background for in person shadowing experiences."

Each morning, I was responsible for the feeding, bathing, dressing, and care for this man. He had majorly stunted mental capabilities, and each seizure had the potential to further stunt his mental abilities or even cause death. As these drop-fall seizures were dangerous and unexpected, my job was to catch and hold him through the seizure to avoid further injuries. I worked in this position for 9 months, working approximately 13 hours a week.\n\n\nLearnings\nThis job was a stressful one, as the family told me from day one that the man would one day pass away from his seizures, and there was a chance that could happen while I worked with him. This helped me learn how to “leave work at work”. I was attending school full-time, and I didn’t have the mental fortitude to deal with that stress along with my academics at the beginning. At the end of this experience, I am happy to say that I had learned how to effectively manage my mental load.\nAlso, as the man had severe autism, I learned how to be compassionate with those who struggled in expressing themselves. The patient was unable to communicate at all, but he was receptive to social expressions. By the end of my time at this job, the patient and I had a relationship, something that was difficult for the patient to do."

Much of the work was typical CNA-type things, including toileting, dressing, feeding, and medication assistance. I worked in this position for 2 months, working roughly 9 hours a week.\n\n\nLearnings\nSpending time with this man was very informative for me in my path in becoming a physician. Up until this experience, I hadn’t spent much time with elderly patients. I was able to see the functions of a rest home while only being responsible for one patient.

I was responsible for the overnight care of the patient. Where he has muscle atrophy, he cannot roll around, but where it isn’t paralysis, he could feel when bed sores were being formed. Therefore, my main task was to help him get into bed, roll him when he needed rolled, and provide CNA-type care when needed, including toileting, transferring, and cooking. I worked in this position for 6 months, working roughly 28 hours a week. Over Winter Break 2022, I was able to work with the man for 20 hours as well.\n\n\nLearnings\nThis job was informative because it was my first form of patient contact where the patient was competent mentally. This allowed for a different kind of caretaker/patient relationship. The patient and I truly became friends. With his condition and his mental wellbeing, he was able to tell me when he was uncomfortable, showing me a new light in being as careful and kind to patients as possible. This position turned into so much more than a job; instead it turned into an opportunity to provide help to someone who physically cannot themselves. This has been a transformative experience for me thus far, and I am excited to continue to learn."

    "text": "Utah Council of Undergraduate Research (UCUR) - February 2023\nThis presentation took place in a venue for different undergraduate institutions across the state, and it was hosted at the University of Utah this year.\n\n\n\nClick to Download \n\nAbstract\nPrior research has investigated the recruitment and retention of certain student identities (such as gender and ethnicity) in STEM courses and careers. Recruitment and retention in STEM can be influenced by a student’s connection to the STEM community, science identity, and engagement. Yet none of this research has investigated the impact of having either a medical experience or chronic condition on our STEM students despite other research indicating medical students with medical conditions are less likely to complete their degree. Additionally, individuals with medical conditions tend to feel disconnected from others and experience higher levels of stress during their life. Thus, it is important to study the potential impacts of medical experiences and conditions on undergraduate students. This study explores the potential impacts of having a medical experience or chronic condition on students taking science classes at an open enrollment institution. Specifically, we hypothesized acute medical experiences may include a limited number of interruptions to one’s daily lifestyle and education and thus have a smaller impact on science students in comparison to students with chronic medical conditions. We specially focused on how acute medical experiences and chronic conditions may be related to varying levels of student science career motivation, science interest, science self-determination, engagement of science outside of the classroom, communal view of science, and value of peers in their classroom. Pre-course data was collected from 1280 students across 14 biology courses (including non-majors) taught by 16 different instructors at a focused-teaching institution. Surprisingly, 55% of students surveyed reported having an experience with an acute medical condition and 20% reported having a chronic condition. This indicates that medical experiences and chronic medical conditions are indeed an important and large identity to investigate further. Interestingly, there were no significant variations for students with acute medical experiences across science career motivation, science interest, science self-determination, engagement of science outside of the classroom, communal view of science, and value of peers in their classroom. However, we did see significant differences for students with chronic medical conditions depending on the major of the student (biology major, non-biology STEM major, pre-health professional major, or non-STEM major). Specifically, non-STEM majors had more appreciation and engagement with STEM if they also had a chronic medical condition. Further investigation of the potential differences for students with chronic medical conditions will continue to be explored with a post-survey."

This trend is particularly pronounced in STEM disciplines. FGSs are more likely to be communally oriented which contrasts the typical values of universities that value individual accomplishments. This generates a disconnect between FGS’s values and the perceived values of STEM. However, limited data is available from teaching institutions that are open-enrollment. In addition, few studies have examined peer interactions as a specific source of science motivation and communal views of science. This study examined student’s cooperative experiences with peers and STEM motivation through pre/post-test survey collection within STEM classes. Students were asked questions addressing STEM motivation, the value of working with others and their community, and the community orientation of STEM disciplines. Early results show that FGS do indeed rely on cooperative experiences with peers to judge the communal orientation of science which then impacts their science motivation. We predict that similar trends will be seen for women and that these trends will be significantly weaker for CGSs. Our next steps include continuing with the data analysis. Also, this survey was taken when COVID-19 caused an emergency transition to online learning. Future data collection will provide a comparison to better understand the impacts of the emergency transition on STEM students."

I was involved with this for 3 months, giving roughly 33 hours a month towards leadership.\n\n\nLearning\nBeing a Fellow in this program taught me how to be a better part of a team, particularly in a virtual nature. The idea of science and technology being socially-directed taught me the importance of making and maintaining relationships. This helped me become a better leader because I put a higher value on my relationships."

Part of this class required us to do service in the community that we wouldn’t otherwise do. Between both semesters, I was able to use some of the life experiences I had in order to help other students going through similar issues. My mother is a health aide at the local school district, and there was a student who was type one diabetic and was about to graduate. He had poor diabetes habits, and I was asked to work with him to provide tips and tricks to adjusting to living on your own with diabetes. That was roughly 8 of these hours.\nThe other 7 hours came as I met with other individual students. I shared things I had learned from my experiences, such as with Station 1, the things I shared in my Wolverine Story, among other things. My goal here was to help each person I met with know that there is a place for them here.\n\n\nLearnings\nOverall, the thing I learned the most with these experiences was that I have a need to give back. I have had many people help me along my path, guiding me through diabetes, through school, and through general life challenges. I need to give back to others and be the same voice for them that I had in my life. Overall, students need to know they are not alone, that they are not “weirdos”, and this service helped me convey that to others. All in all, it helped me step outside of myself and be aware of the needs and struggles of others."

It truly lifted my spirits as a patient.\nWith the research that I do on campus, I knew that I wanted to implement some of the same sort of event at Primary Children’s. Seeing as I am studying how having medical conditions leads to science motivation, I want to provide an event where the science behind the medical care is made fun. We plan on teaching how x-rays work, what the heart looks like, what laboratory work looks like, etc. I applied for and was granted an URSCA Grant to pay for the toys and such needed for the event. Some of that funding is also going to an assistant student employee that will work underneath me, assisting me in this project. I will not be funded for this project, but he will, allowing him to add things to his medical school application.\n\n\nLearnings\nSo far, the majority of the work has been with preparing the grant.

In this first course, there were 9 Cases, and after each case there was a quiz regarding things that were covered in the video case. The cases covered were across a broad range: pregnancy and asthma, travelers’ diarrhea, epilepsy, gastritis, heart attack, hematoma, anaphylaxis, COVID, and renal failure. The videos were given through a mock-visit with a patient, where the physician first meets the mock patient and cares for them as they would a typical patient. Essentially, we viewers were a fly on the wall who could see the whole process of treating these patients. You can learn more about this awesome course here. I finished this course over 1 month, averaging 3 hours a week going through this shadowing experience. Click here to download the certificate I was granted.\n\n\nLearnings\nWith my service in the American Fork Emergency Room, I felt like I had a decent grasp on how emergency rooms worked already. This shadowing opportunity gave me new insights into the treatment of patients in the ER. In my experience, I usually saw the tests and labs being run, with me checking on the patients where I was able. Rarely, there was the major trauma patient that came in, and when that happened, I could see how the physicians quickly cared for that patient. This shadowing experience let me see what initial contact with a patient and physician would look like, depending on the case and the symptoms. Not every case was a major trauma, and therefore, the ability to collect information from the patient and think quickly on their feet was shown to me. I felt like it showed me how to create trust with a patient from the beginning, and it was very informative. I think it gave me a really good background for in person shadowing experiences."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In conclusion, this study sheds light on the potential impact of medical experiences and chronic conditions on students taking science classes at an open enrollment institution. The findings indicate that a considerable number of students, around 57%, reported having a medical experience, while 22% reported having a chronic condition. These numbers highlight the significance of investigating the influence of medical identities on students’ experiences further. The study’s main hypotheses were supported, revealing that an increase in academic interruptions due to medical experiences led to decreased science motivation, as well as lower senses of belonging, self-efficacy, and self-determination.\n\nNegative Effects\nIt was particularly interesting to observe that students who had more medical interruptions experienced a notable decrease in their sense of belonging and self-efficacy, emphasizing the potential challenges that medical experiences can pose to academic engagement and self-confidence. This insight is crucial for educators and institutions to recognize and address, as it may have profound implications for students’ overall success and well-being in science courses.\n\n\nPositive Effects\nHowever, a noteworthy and encouraging finding was that some students who had experienced medical experiences displayed higher levels of science immersion and motivation. This suggests that medical experiences can also positively influence student engagement with science, potentially prompting students to explore these experiences further within the context of scientific understanding. These positive associations between medical experiences and science motivation are promising, as they may indicate pathways for fostering increased interest and participation in scientific disciplines among affected students.\n\n\nImportance\nIn light of these results, it becomes evident that acknowledging and accommodating medical identities and experiences in science education is paramount. By recognizing the potential challenges students face due to medical interruptions and offering support and inclusive teaching strategies, educators can help mitigate the negative effects on students’ sense of belonging and self-efficacy. Moreover, incorporating medical experiences into the curriculum could harness the positive influence they have on science motivation, thereby fostering a more engaging and supportive learning environment for all students.\n\n\nNext Steps\nMoving forward, science instructors and institutions should consider the implications of this study as they modify course content and pedagogy to be more inclusive and supportive of students with medical experiences and chronic conditions. Emphasizing a student-centered approach and providing appropriate resources can help create a conducive learning environment where all identities, including those shaped by medical experiences, are embraced and empowered. By doing so, science education can evolve to be more inclusive, enriching the educational journey of all students and ultimately contributing to a more diverse and innovative scientific community."

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to Porter at portergbischoff@gmail.com !\n\n\nPrior research has investigated the recruitment and retention of certain student identities (such as gender and ethnicity) in STEM courses and careers. Success in STEM can be influenced by a student’s connection to the STEM community, science identity, and engagement. Despite this, no research has investigated the impact of having either a medical experience or chronic condition on STEM students despite research indicating medical students with medical conditions are less likely to complete their degree. Additionally, individuals with medical conditions tend to feel disconnected from others and experience higher levels of stress during their life. Thus, it is important to study the potential impacts of medical experiences and conditions on undergraduate students’ STEM motivation.\nThis study explores the potential impact of having a medical experience or chronic condition for students taking science classes at an open enrollment institution. Specifically, we hypothesized that an increase in academic interruptions due to a medical experience would result in decreased science motivation, a lower sense of belonging, self-efficacy, and self-determination. Pre- and post-course data were collected from 390 students across 14 biology courses (including non-majors) at a teaching-focused institution. Surprisingly, 57% of students surveyed reported having a medical experience and 22% reported having a chronic condition, indicating these are indeed an important and large identity to investigate further.\nAs predicted, students who have more medical interruptions have a significantly lower sense of belonging and self-efficacy (small effect size). Interestingly, students who indicated that they have had medical experiences and as a result, more engagement with science, have significantly higher science immersion and motivation. Therefore, medical experiences could be influencing student engagement with science in both positive and negative ways. The more interruptions to a student’s academics, the more impact it can have on their sense of belonging and self-efficacy. However, if those medical experiences result in more engagement with science, students may be more motivated to understand those experiences in the context of science. Information on the impact medical experiences can have on students is crucial to investigate as science instructors modify course content and pedagogy to be more inclusive of all identities present in the student population.\n\n\n\nPorter Bischoff*, Kody Garrett, Clayton Rawson, Joshua Premo, Brittney N.
