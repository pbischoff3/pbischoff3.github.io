<h1>When Students Miss class Due to a Medical Condition, Are They Engaging More with Science?</h1>
<p>Welcome to the website for our poster! It is here we will go through some of the traditional aspects of a poster, including the “Introduction”, “Methods”, “Results”, and “Conclusion”.

<section id="abstract" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Prior research has investigated the recruitment and retention of certain student identities (such as gender and ethnicity) in STEM courses and careers. Success in STEM can be influenced by a student’s connection to the STEM community, science identity, and engagement. Despite this, no research has investigated the impact of having either a medical experience or chronic condition on STEM students despite research indicating medical students with medical conditions are less likely to complete their degree. Additionally, individuals with medical conditions tend to feel disconnected from others and experience higher levels of stress during their life. Thus, it is important to study the potential impacts of medical experiences and conditions on undergraduate students’ STEM motivation.</p>
<p>This study explores the potential impact of having a medical experience or chronic condition for students taking science classes at an open enrollment institution. Specifically, we hypothesized that an increase in academic interruptions due to a medical experience would result in decreased science motivation, a lower sense of belonging, self-efficacy, and self-determination. Pre- and post-course data were collected from 390 students across 14 biology courses (including non-majors) at a teaching-focused institution. Surprisingly, 57% of students surveyed reported having a medical experience and 22% reported having a chronic condition, indicating these are indeed an important and large identity to investigate further.</p>
<p>As predicted, students who have more medical interruptions have a significantly lower sense of belonging and self-efficacy (small effect size). Interestingly, students who indicated that they have had medical experiences and as a result, more engagement with science, have significantly higher science immersion and motivation. Therefore, medical experiences could be influencing student engagement with science in both positive and negative ways. The more interruptions to a student’s academics, the more impact it can have on their sense of belonging and self-efficacy. However, if those medical experiences result in more engagement with science, students may be more motivated to understand those experiences in the context of science. Information on the impact medical experiences can have on students is crucial to investigate as science instructors modify course content and pedagogy to be more inclusive of all identities present in the student population.</p>

<h1>Background</h1>
<p>Experiences in the classrooms can lead to an increase of STEM motivation. This can come through many different aspects of the classroom experience. One <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tea.21623">study</a> explored the positive impact that performing science practices (like hypothesizing or explaining results) can increase a students’ “felt recognition” and “classroom climate”, and these two factors increases students’ STEM motivation, STEM identity, and STEM career aspirations. Another <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4657866/">study</a> shares that an “intervention emphasizing communal utility value of biomedical research” can greatly increase a students’ motivation for biomedical sciences. The study also compared “self-oriented” versus “other-oriented” utility values, showing that “other-oriented” unity values shows a higher student motivation.</p>
<p>Personal experiences can also have a large influence on one’s STEM motivation. A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2923.1999.00293.x">study</a> explored a cohort of medical students in Norway and their motivation to go into medicine. Though this is not necessarily “STEM” motivation, the comparison of medicine to STEM fields is important to note. This study went through different life experiences that the students had and compared those back to motivation for different fields in medicine. This was done through a survey, and they asked questions like “opportunity to perform research”, opportunity to care for people”, or “interest in relations between health, well-being and society”. All of these are based on experiences that students might have had on in the past in their lives, and findings show that these experiences can have a significant impact on the paths medical doctors choose. Another <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10648-022-09700-6">study</a> explores literature regarding Black and Latinx students’ STEM motivation. In this literature review, it is clear that the life experiences that these student have can have a significant impact on their STEM motivation, compared back to experiences of the whole student population.</p>
<p>Personal experiences with medicine can influence career choice. A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25544332/">study</a> explores the literature out there regarding how experiences in surgery can have an impact on their career choice. Particularly, much of the literature explores the role that rotations in medical school can influence career choice. This study makes it clear that the experiences people have with medicine can significantly impact what they choose to become. Another <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/0142159X.2013.769673">study</a> explores the reasons students choose to go into medicine. Many of the common answers included “intellectual curiosity, professional autonomy, altruism, and interest in human relationships”. However, in this study, it was clear that students motivated by personal illness or family member’s illness “revealed significant[ly] greater emotional exhaustion”. This makes it clear that our experiences in life can influence our decision to go into medicine.</p>
<p>Chronic illnesses and medical experiences can potentially lead to more interruptions. One <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9408520/">study</a> explores the connection between chronic illness and suicidal ideation in adults in South Korea. What they found was that people with chronic illnesses need attention given to them in order to decrease suicidal ideation. Where suicide is tied to depression, the connection between having a chronic condition and potentially missing class becomes clear, as the students could miss more class due to the increase in depression. Another <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s15010-015-0801-y">study</a> explores how having chronic illnesses increase the incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia in older adults. In particular, it goes into what specific illnesses could cause an increase in incidence of pneumonia. Comparing this back to our study, students with chronic conditions could miss more classes due to illnesses (like pneumonia). Lastly, another <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02088595">study</a> shows the influence that chronic illnesses (especially diabetes and psychiatric conditions) have on a person’s self-esteem. If a student has lower self-esteem, they may feel less likely to attend class, and therefore, these chronic conditions can lead to more medical interruptions.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="motivation-for-the-project">Motivation for the Project</h2>
<p>Porter has had a slew of medical experiences, and these experiences led him to pursue a career path in medicine. While going through his undergraduate experience, preparing for medical school, he found a real passion for science as well as medicine. Because this was relatively late in his education, he wishes that he knew this passion he had before his undergraduate studies. Therefore, this project was born, hoping to find that Porter wasn’t uncommon in his experience and assisting other students understand their passions for science sooner than later.

<h1>Methods</h1>
<p>We used an adapted survey from other literature to find information regarding STEM motivation. This survey was given pre-semester and post-semester to 14 different Biology courses at Utah Valley University. These classes had students who were both STEM majors and non-majors, as these classes were generally General Education classes. Utah Valley University is an open enrollment institution, making this data an interesting set to explore.</p>
<p>390 students answered the pre/post-semester surveys. We have a large number of pre-semester data, but only 390 responded to both the beginning and end of the semester survey.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>In conclusion, this study sheds light on the potential impact of medical experiences and chronic conditions on students taking science classes at an open enrollment institution. The findings indicate that a considerable number of students, around 57%, reported having a medical experience, while 22% reported having a chronic condition. These numbers highlight the significance of investigating the influence of medical identities on students’ experiences further. The study’s main hypotheses were supported, revealing that an increase in academic interruptions due to medical experiences led to decreased science motivation, as well as lower senses of belonging, self-efficacy, and self-determination.</p>
<section id="negative-effects" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="negative-effects">Negative Effects</h2>
<p>It was particularly interesting to observe that students who had more medical interruptions experienced a notable decrease in their sense of belonging and self-efficacy, emphasizing the potential challenges that medical experiences can pose to academic engagement and self-confidence. This insight is crucial for educators and institutions to recognize and address, as it may have profound implications for students’ overall success and well-being in science courses.</p>
</section>
<section id="positive-effects" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="positive-effects">Positive Effects</h2>
<p>However, a noteworthy and encouraging finding was that some students who had experienced medical experiences displayed higher levels of science immersion and motivation. This suggests that medical experiences can also positively influence student engagement with science, potentially prompting students to explore these experiences further within the context of scientific understanding. These positive associations between medical experiences and science motivation are promising, as they may indicate pathways for fostering increased interest and participation in scientific disciplines among affected students.</p>
</section>
<section id="importance" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="importance">Importance</h2>
<p>In light of these results, it becomes evident that acknowledging and accommodating medical identities and experiences in science education is paramount. By recognizing the potential challenges students face due to medical interruptions and offering support and inclusive teaching strategies, educators can help mitigate the negative effects on students’ sense of belonging and self-efficacy. Moreover, incorporating medical experiences into the curriculum could harness the positive influence they have on science motivation, thereby fostering a more engaging and supportive learning environment for all students.</p>
</section>
<section id="next-steps" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>Moving forward, science instructors and institutions should consider the implications of this study as they modify course content and pedagogy to be more inclusive and supportive of students with medical experiences and chronic conditions. Emphasizing a student-centered approach and providing appropriate resources can help create a conducive learning environment where all identities, including those shaped by medical experiences, are embraced and empowered. By doing so, science education can evolve to be more inclusive, enriching the educational journey of all students and ultimately contributing to a more diverse and innovative scientific community.</p>
