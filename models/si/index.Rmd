```

Let's check out Career Motivation models. <br>

## Major
Let's see the influence that the difference in majors have an the average of Career Motivation questions:
<br>
```{r echo=FALSE}
cm_mod_1 <- glm(data = df,
                formula = career_mot_ave ~ major)
summary(cm_mod_1)
```
<br>
This shows that those who study Biology have a significantly higher Career Motivation, while Non-STEM majors answer significantly lower. <br>

This is great, but it is difficult to understand this in context until we compare it to the other models. 
<br>

## Career
Now, let's look at how career goals affect the average of Career Motivation questions:
<br>
```{r echo=FALSE}
cm_mod_2 <- glm(data = df,
                formula = career_mot_ave ~ career)
summary(cm_mod_2)
```
<br>
This shows that those who aspire to be Dentists have significantly higher Career Motivation. <br>

Now let's run from another model's point of view. <br>

## Ethnicity
How about we look at how different ethnicities affect Career Motivation? <br>

```{r echo=FALSE}
cm_mod_3 <- glm(data = df,
                formula = career_mot_ave ~ ethnicity)
summary(cm_mod_3)
```
<br>
This shows that African-Americans have a significantly lower Career Motivation, while American Indians, Arabs, Asians, those who are Biracial, Latinx, and Caucasians have a significantly higher Career Motivation. <br>

One last model. Let's check it out. 

## Medical Conditions
Here is the model according to a presence of medical conditions or not. <br>
```{r echo=FALSE}
cm_mod_4 <- glm(data = df,
                formula = career_mot_ave ~ med_condition)
summary(cm_mod_4)
```
<br>

This shows that those who do not have medical conditions have a significantly lower Career Motivation.

## Conclusion
Now that we have those 4 models according to the demographic that we are interested in, let's compare them against each other to see which models were best in determining Career Motivation. <br>

```{r echo=FALSE}
compare_models(cm_mod_1,cm_mod_2,cm_mod_3,cm_mod_4, style = "se_p") 

```
<br> 
This shows everything that we have performed thus far, but now let's add some statistical analysis to it.
<br>
```{r echo=FALSE}
compare_performance(cm_mod_1,cm_mod_2,cm_mod_3,cm_mod_4) 

```
<br>
To put all of this in English, we are most interested in those that have higher R^2 values and lower BIC, AIC, and RMSE values. According to that knowledge, it looks like Ethnicity and Medical Conditions are the best predictor for Career Motivation. Let's see these together, and with that, we can see whether how they relate. 
<br>

```{r echo=FALSE}
cm_mod_5 <- glm(data=df,
                formula = career_mot_ave ~ ethnicity + med_condition)
summary(cm_mod_5) 
compare_models(cm_mod_5) %>% plot()
```

<br>

Well awesome, this gives us a great place that we can start in further data analysis in our project. <br>
