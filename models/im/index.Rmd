Let's check out Intrinsic Motivation models. <br>

## Major
Let's see the influence that the difference in majors have an the average of Intrinsic Motivation questions:
<br>
```{r echo=FALSE}
im_mod_1 <- glm(data = df,
                formula = intrinsic_mot_ave ~ major)
summary(im_mod_1)
```
<br>
This shows that those who study Health Science majors answer significantly lower Intrinsic Motivation than the rest of the groups of majors.  <br>

This is great, but it is difficult to understand this in context until we compare it to the other models. 
<br>

## Career
Now, let's look at how career goals affect the average of Intrinsic Motivation questions:
<br>
```{r echo=FALSE}
im_mod_2 <- glm(data = df,
                formula = intrinsic_mot_ave ~ career)
summary(im_mod_2)
```
<br>
This shows that there are no significant differences between career goals and Intrinsic Motivation. <br>

Now let's run from another model's point of view. <br>

## Ethnicity
How about we look at how different ethnicities affect Intrinsic Motivation? <br>

```{r echo=FALSE}
im_mod_3 <- glm(data = df,
                formula = intrinsic_mot_ave ~ ethnicity)
summary(im_mod_3)
```
<br>
This shows that American Indians, Arabs, Asians, those who are Biracial, Latinx, Caucasians, and those who prefer not to answer have significantly higher Intrinsic Motivation. <br>

One last model. Let's check it out. 

## Medical Conditions
Here is the model according to a presence of medical conditions or not. <br>
```{r echo=FALSE}
im_mod_4 <- glm(data = df,
                formula = intrinsic_mot_ave ~ med_condition)
summary(im_mod_4)
```
<br>

This shows that those who do not have medical conditions have a significantly lower Intrinsic Motivation.

## Conclusion
Now that we have those 4 models according to the demographic that we are interested in, let's compare them against each other to see which models were best in determining Intrinsic Motivation. <br>

```{r echo=FALSE}
compare_models(im_mod_1,im_mod_2,im_mod_3,im_mod_4, style = "se_p") 

```
<br> 
This shows everything that we have performed thus far, but now let's add some statistical analysis to it.
<br>
```{r echo=FALSE}
compare_performance(im_mod_1,im_mod_2,im_mod_3,im_mod_4) 

```
<br>
To put all of this in English, we are most interested in those that have higher R^2 values and lower BIC, AIC, and RMSE values. According to that knowledge, it looks like Major and Ethnicity are the best predictor for Intrinsic Motivation. Let's see these together, and with that, we can see whether how they relate. 
<br>

```{r echo=FALSE}
im_mod_5 <- glm(data=df,
                formula = intrinsic_mot_ave ~ major + ethnicity)
summary(im_mod_5) 
compare_models(im_mod_5) %>% plot()
```

Well awesome, this gives us a great place that we can start in further data analysis in our project. <br> <br>
