```{r background, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
source(file = "./R/Code/01-cleaning_data.R")
```

Let's check out Self-Determination models. <br>

## Major
Let's see the influence that the difference in majors have an the average of Self-Determination questions:
<br>
```{r echo=FALSE}
sd_mod_1 <- glm(data = df,
                formula = self_determition_ave ~ major)
summary(sd_mod_1)
```
<br>
This shows that those who study Health Science majors answer significantly lower Self-Determination than the rest of the groups of majors.  <br>

This is great, but it is difficult to understand this in context until we compare it to the other models. 
<br>

## Career
Now, let's look at how career goals affect the average of Self-Determination questions:
<br>
```{r echo=FALSE}
sd_mod_2 <- glm(data = df,
                formula = self_determition_ave ~ career)
summary(sd_mod_2)
```
<br>
This shows that those pursuing STEM careers have lower Self-Determination than the rest of the career goals. <br>

Now let's run from another model's point of view. <br>

## Ethnicity
How about we look at how different ethnicities affect Self-Determination? <br>

```{r echo=FALSE}
sd_mod_3 <- glm(data = df,
                formula = self_determition_ave ~ ethnicity)
summary(sd_mod_3)
```
<br>
This shows that American Indians, Arabs, Asians, those who are Biracial, Latinx, and Caucasians have significantly higher Self-Determination. <br>

One last model. Let's check it out. 

## Medical Conditions
Here is the model according to a presence of medical conditions or not. <br>
```{r echo=FALSE}
sd_mod_4 <- glm(data = df,
                formula = self_determition_ave ~ med_condition)
summary(sd_mod_4)
```
<br>

This shows that Medical Conditions does not have an influence on Self-Determination.

## Conclusion
Now that we have those 4 models according to the demographic that we are interested in, let's compare them against each other to see which models were best in determining Self-Determination. <br>

```{r echo=FALSE}
compare_models(sd_mod_1,sd_mod_2,sd_mod_3,sd_mod_4, style = "se_p") 

```
<br> 
This shows everything that we have performed thus far, but now let's add some statistical analysis to it.
<br>
```{r echo=FALSE}
compare_performance(sd_mod_1,sd_mod_2,sd_mod_3,sd_mod_4) 

```
<br>
To put all of this in English, we are most interested in those that have higher R^2 values and lower BIC, AIC, and RMSE values. According to that knowledge, it looks like Ethnicity, Majors, and Careers are the best predictor for Self-Determination. Let's see these together, and with that, we can see whether how they relate. 
<br>

```{r echo=FALSE}
sd_mod_5 <- glm(data=df,
                formula = self_determition_ave ~ major + ethnicity + career)
summary(sd_mod_5) 
compare_models(sd_mod_5) %>% plot()
```


Well awesome, this gives us a great place that we can start in further data analysis in our project. <br>
