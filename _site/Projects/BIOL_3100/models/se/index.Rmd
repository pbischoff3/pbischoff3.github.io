```{r background, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
source(file = "../../R/Code/01-cleaning_data.R")
```

Let's check out Self-Efficacy models. <br>

## Major
Let's see the influence that the difference in majors have an the average of Self-Efficacy questions:
<br>
```{r echo=FALSE}
se_mod_1 <- glm(data = df,
                formula = self_efficacy_ave ~ major)
summary(se_mod_1)
```
<br>
This shows that those who study Health Science and Other majors answer significantly lower Self-Efficacy than the rest of the groups of majors.  <br>

This is great, but it is difficult to understand this in context until we compare it to the other models. 
<br>

## Career
Now, let's look at how career goals affect the average of Self-Efficacy questions:
<br>
```{r echo=FALSE}
se_mod_2 <- glm(data = df,
                formula = self_efficacy_ave ~ career)
summary(se_mod_2)
```
<br>
This shows that those pursuing Healthcare Professional careers have lower Self-Efficacy than the rest of the career goals. <br>

Now let's run from another model's point of view. <br>

## Ethnicity
How about we look at how different ethnicities affect Self-Efficacy? <br>

```{r echo=FALSE}
se_mod_3 <- glm(data = df,
                formula = self_efficacy_ave ~ ethnicity)
summary(se_mod_3)
```
<br>
This shows that American Indians, Arabs, Asians, those who are Biracial, Latinx, and Caucasians have significantly higher Self-Efficacy. <br>

One last model. Let's check it out. 

## Medical Conditions
Here is the model according to a presence of medical conditions or not. <br>
```{r echo=FALSE}
se_mod_4 <- glm(data = df,
                formula = self_efficacy_ave ~ med_condition)
summary(se_mod_4)
```
<br>

This shows that Medical Conditions does not have an influence on Self-Efficacy.

## Conclusion
Now that we have those 4 models according to the demographic that we are interested in, let's compare them against each other to see which models were best in determining Self-Efficacy. <br>

```{r echo=FALSE}
compare_models(se_mod_1,se_mod_2,se_mod_3,se_mod_4, style = "se_p") 

```
<br> 
This shows everything that we have performed thus far, but now let's add some statistical analysis to it.
<br>
```{r echo=FALSE}
compare_performance(se_mod_1,se_mod_2,se_mod_3,se_mod_4) 

```
<br>
To put all of this in English, we are most interested in those that have higher R^2 values and lower BIC, AIC, and RMSE values. According to that knowledge, it looks like all models may be significant in predicting Self-Efficacy. Let's see these together, and with that, we can see whether how they relate. 
<br>

```{r echo=FALSE}
se_mod_5 <- glm(data=df,
                formula = self_efficacy_ave ~ major + ethnicity + career + med_condition)
summary(se_mod_5) 
compare_models(se_mod_5) %>% plot()
```

Well awesome, this gives us a great place that we can start in further data analysis in our project. <br><br>
