This data is survey data collected at Utah Valley University in the Spring and Fall 2020 semesters. The survey explores different aspects of science motivation, with a goal of understanding what things may have an effect on a student's science motivation. The questions were adapted from other surveys found in the literature review conducted. Different aspects of demographics were measured, as well. These are the different aspects of science motivation that we explored:
<br>

## **Purpose of the Experiment**
In my experiences in life, I have had many medical experiences that have affected who I am today. This has caused me to have a desire my whole life to enter the medical field. As I got in college, I jumped right into the sciences because "that is what you have to do" to get into medical school. Along the way in my undergraduate experience, I found that I have a love for science that I didn't realize. I now want to be a medical doctor *and* a scientist. I decided I wanted to learn whether or not this was a normal course for science motivation or if I was just a weirdo. Through background literature review, we found that there are many studies exploring having medical conditions *leading* to a desire to enter the medical field, but there has been no study regarding medical experiences leading to science motivation. Therefore, we are studying it. Our hypothesis is that there are other people like me, that medical conditions do lead to a higher science motivation. Therefore, we essentially took a typical science motivation questionnaire that our lab group has used in the past and threw on a couple of questions on regarding medical experiences. Boring? Maybe a little bit, but we are hoping that this research will help influence doctors, teachers, parents, or anyone dealing with potential STEM students to help encourage those students into the STEM fields.
