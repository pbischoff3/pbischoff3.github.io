In 2021, we worked on getting IRB approval for my project at UVU. Eventually, we were granted that approval in getting UVU IRB #936. The rest of the year was spent in data collection, preparing for eventual presentation on what we had discovered.

In the meantime, I worked on another side project regarding how Covid influenced First Generation Student's experiences in science. This presentation was presented on in January of 2022.

## Station1 Closing Conference - August 2021
In 2021, I was also given the opportunity to be a part of the [Station1 Frontiers Fellowship](https://www.station1.org/sff). At the end of this marvelous experience, we presented on what we had learned in studying stem cell therapies for the curing of incurable diseases. See the presentation below.
