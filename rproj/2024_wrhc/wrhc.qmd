# Abstract

This study explores the impact of chronic conditions on STEM motivation among undergraduate students, addressing a gap in existing research that primarily focuses on gender and ethnicity. Specifically, we investigate how medical experiences, especially chronic conditions, influence students in science classes at an open enrollment institution, considering demographics such as first-
generation status, gender, major, and career goals.

Data from 390 students across 14 biology courses, including non-majors, were collected before and after the courses. Surprisingly, 57% reported medical experiences, with 22% having chronic conditions, emphasizing their significance within the diverse student population.

Students facing more medical interruptions exhibited a notable decrease in their sense of belonging and self-efficacy, albeit with a small effect size. Intriguingly, across demographics, students with chronic conditions engaging more with science showed significantly higher levels of motivation and immersion. This suggests that chronic conditions can both positively and negatively influence student engagement with science.

The impact of medical interruptions on academics is closely linked to students' sense of belonging and self-efficacy. 

However, increased engagement with science due to chronic conditions may motivate students to explore these experiences within the context of scientific inquiry.

Understanding how chronic conditions shape students' motivation is crucial for science instructors to adapt their course content and pedagogy, fostering inclusivity and recognizing diverse identities across different demographic dimensions.

# Motivation for the Project

Porter has had a slew of medical experiences, and these experiences led him to pursue a career path in medicine. While going through his undergraduate experience, preparing for medical school, he found a real passion for science as well as medicine. Because this was relatively late in his education, he wishes that he knew this passion he had before his undergraduate studies. Therefore, this project was born, hoping to find that Porter wasn't uncommon in his experience and assisting other students understand their passions for science sooner than later.

# Methods

We used an adapted survey from other literature to find information regarding STEM motivation. This survey was given pre-semester and post-semester to 14 different Biology courses at Utah Valley University. These classes had students who were both STEM majors and non-majors, as these classes were generally General Education classes. Utah Valley University is an open enrollment institution, making this data an interesting set to explore.

390 students answered the pre/post-semester surveys. We have a large number of pre-semester data, but only 390 responded to both the beginning and end of the semester survey.

## STEM Motivation Questions

Here are the questions that we asked to determine the different aspects of STEM motivation.

## Statistical Analysis

We used paired and upaired T-Tests to properly understand the significance data for each of the aspects. We are excited to continue doing analysis on this data set, as we know that we can dive deeper into it.

## Technology

SPSS was used to complete the Pearson Correlation. R packages were used to create the plots.
