## About Me
My name is Porter Bischoff. I am from Heber City, UT, and I am currently a undergraduate student at Utah Valley University. I am studying Biotechnology, and I hope to pursue an MD/PhD degree following my time here. <br><br>
While studying at UVU, I have been blessed with so many wonderful opportunities. As a biotech student, I was granted the [NSF S-STEM scholarship](https://www.uvu.edu/biology/s_stem_scholarship.html), allowing me to have a strong focus on research I am interested in as an undergraduate. I was involved with Station1 as a [Station1 Frontiers Fellow](https://www.station1.org/sff). This was a wonderful experience that included "an exciting research internship in emerging areas of science and technology with leading established and startup partner companies, research institutes, and nonprofit organizations, a cross-interdisciplinary shared curriculum, and personal and professional advancement activities including inclusive leadership and collaboration, scientific and technical communication, networking, and more." I worked with [GC Therapeutics](https://www.gc-tx.com/) as an intern following my time with Station1, and this provided me the unique experience of working with a biotech startup on the cutting edge of curing incurable diseases through stem cell implantation. Currently, I am an intern at Utah Valley University with Provost Wayne Vaught, as his [Presidential Intern](https://www.uvu.edu/president/interns/index.html). I am excited for the opportunities and experience that this position will hold. <br><br>
I am the oldest of 5, and I love my family so much. They are truly my best friends. I have a dog named Bubba that enjoys doing homework with me, and I love watching basketball. Sadly, I am a disappointed Utah Jazz fan.
