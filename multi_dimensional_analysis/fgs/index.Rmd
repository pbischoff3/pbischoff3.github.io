```


## Function
To begin, let's explore the function we created to run all of this statistical analysis:
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
mysubsetMDS <- function(x){
  mysubset <- df %>% 
    select(starts_with(x))
  
  meta <- metaMDS(mysubset)
  MDS_df <- data.frame(MDS1=meta$points[,1],MDS2=meta$points[,2]) %>%
    cbind(demo)
  return(MDS_df)
}
```
<br>
In English, this function allows us to run the MDS according to each subset of demographic and each subset of question type that we want. Obviously, in this page, we are exploring First Generation Student status.

## Question Types
### Science Identity
Let's explore the science identity subset of questions first. Running our function we created and plotting it, we are left with this image of the plot:<br>
![](../../R/Images/parents_grad_college/si.png)
<br> This is great and all, but let's run an adonis test to see if there is a significant difference in how different First Generation Student status goals responded to science identity questions:
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
adonis(si ~ demo$parents_grad_college)
```
This shows that the differences in answers are not significant, according to First Generation Student status. <br>

<br>

### Career Motivation
Next, let's look into Carer Motivation: <br>
![](../../R/Images/parents_grad_college/cm.png)
<br>
And an Adonis test:
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
adonis(cm ~ demo$parents_grad_college)
```
This shows that the differences in answers are not significant, according to First Generation Student status. <br>
![](../../R/Images/what_is_MDS/no.gif)

<br>

### Intrinsic Motivation
Now, Intrinsic Motivation: <br>
![](../../R/Images/parents_grad_college/im.png)
<br>
And an Adonis test:
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
adonis(im ~ demo$parents_grad_college)
```
This shows that the differences in answers are not significant, according to First Generation Student status. <br>
![](../../R/Images/what_is_MDS/no.gif)

### Self-Determination
Now, Self-Determination: <br>
![](../../R/Images/parents_grad_college/sd.png)
<br>
And an Adonis test:
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
adonis(sd ~ demo$parents_grad_college)
```
This shows that the differences in answers are not significant, according to First Generation Student status. <br>
![](../../R/Images/what_is_MDS/no.gif)

### Self-Efficacy
Now, Self-Efficacy: <br>
![](../../R/Images/parents_grad_college/se.png)
<br>
And an Adonis test:
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
adonis(se ~ demo$parents_grad_college)
```
This shows that the differences in answers are not significant, according to First Generation Student status. <br>
![](../../R/Images/what_is_MDS/no.gif)

### Grade Motivation
Now, Grade Motivation: <br>
![](../../R/Images/parents_grad_college/gm.png)
<br>
And an Adonis test:
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
adonis(gm ~ demo$parents_grad_college)
```
This shows that the differences in answers are not significant, according to First Generation Student status. <br>
![](../../R/Images/what_is_MDS/no.gif)

### Competency in Science
Now, Competency in Science: <br>
![](../../R/Images/parents_grad_college/sci_comp.png)
<br>
And an Adonis test:
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
adonis(sci_comp ~ demo$parents_grad_college)
```
This shows that the differences in answers are not significant, according to First Generation Student status. <br>
![](../../R/Images/what_is_MDS/no.gif)

### Personal Community Orientation
Now, Personal Community Orientation: <br>
![](../../R/Images/parents_grad_college/per_comm_orient.png)
<br>
And an Adonis test:
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
adonis(per_comm_orient ~ demo$parents_grad_college)
```
This shows that the differences in answers are not significant, according to First Generation Student status. <br>
![](../../R/Images/what_is_MDS/no.gif)

### Science Community Orientation
Now, Competency in Science: <br>
![](../../R/Images/parents_grad_college/sci_comm_orient1.png)
<br> Well crap, something is broke there. Let's try running a different form of MDS, giving us a similar analysis in a different way. We can interpret this data similarly to how we did before:
<br> 
![](../../R/Images/parents_grad_college/sci_comm_orient2.png)
<br>
And an Adonis test:
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
adonis(sci_comm_orient ~ demo$parents_grad_college)
```
This shows that the differences in answers are not significant, according to major. <br>

## Conclusion
Ultimately, what we can understand from all of this is that a student's First Generation Student status does not have a significant impact on the the differences in answers in our questions. <br>

In summary, let's take a look at the running list we are making of which questions were significant and not according to demographics: <br>
