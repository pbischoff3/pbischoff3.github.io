Man, this has been a party so far. I hope that you have enjoyed it thus far. <br>

To recap, let's first pull in the summary of all the significance factors according to both the questions and the type of demographic: <br>

<br> 

To put all this in English, it looks like differences in Gender, Parent's Graduating College, Number of Dependents, and Caring for one with Medical Conditions are not significantly different. This **does not** mean that we should just throw out the data; instead, this allows us to start with a couple of models. As this is an opportunity to analyze the data in a different way than we typically would, we are going to create models based on this multi-dimensional analysis, excluding the demographics that did not answer questions significantly different. This is exciting stuff. You'd better be ready.
