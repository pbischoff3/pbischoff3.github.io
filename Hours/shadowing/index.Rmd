## Pie Chart
Due to the pandemic, I have not been able to do any shadowing as of yet. I am excited to report back now that the medical world has "opened up" again. 


I have been involved with virtual shadowing opportunities, and I have plans to shadow my primary care physician over the Christmas break. Though this is bleak now, I have plans for the amount of shadowing to greatly increase before I apply.
